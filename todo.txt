# Data fetch / upload steps

- [x] check get existing is working
  - [x] look at file downloaded from activity page
  - [x] compare this with print of get existing in next step-through
- [x] check get_start_time is working
  - [x] look at first date in existing data
  - [x] check this matches with a print of start_time
- [x] check data merge is going ok
  - [x] look at merged object and check there are no seams between new/existing
- [x] test edge cases (no existing data/first fetch)
  - [x] first fetch:
    - [x] change data tag to make it seem like no existing data
    - [x] then check data uploads ok
    - [x] make sure get existing doesn't get anything
    - [x] make sure get_start_time gets the 2009 date
    - [x] check data is in correct format
  - [x] empty data:
    - [x] make new nokia account with no data in
    - [x] step through with that one
    - [x] make sure data upload of empty dict is in correct format
    - [x] make sure get_start_time goes for the 2009 date
    - [ ] make different case for empty data
- [ ] fix problem with updating on start/end time
  - [ ] do just activity call with no date and get date from that
  - [x] make start date actually change in the while loop
  - [x] get rid of end times when they are optional
  - [ ] find a solution for coding the endpoints which require end
- [ ] add remove_partial function


# Improve UI

- [ ] implement dashboard view as in moves/fitbit
- [ ] tidy up generally and check/improve messages to user

# Next steps

- [ ] add Celery beat timed task?
- [ ] trigger data update for each user
- [ ] fix rate limiting workflow
- [ ] per user realms for rr?
- [x] move data fetch to Celery (out of `views.py`)
- [x] more requests-respectful setup to `settings.py`
- [x] find out why build is failing
